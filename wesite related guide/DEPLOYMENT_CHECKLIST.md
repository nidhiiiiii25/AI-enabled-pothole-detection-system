# Deployment Checklist (Render)

Use this checklist when deploying PatchPoint to Render (or a similar PaaS). It covers both backend and frontend.

## Backend (Web Service)

- Create a new Web Service on Render and connect your GitHub repo.
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `npm run start` (or `node server.js` if configured)
- Instance: choose a plan (free may sleep on inactivity)

### Environment variables (set these in Render dashboard):

- `MONGO_URI` - MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - secure random secret
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - comma-separated allowed origins (e.g. `https://your-frontend.onrender.com`)
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
- `PORT` - not strictly necessary on Render (Render sets it), but can be set to `5000` for parity

### Other backend notes:

- Ensure `backend/public` is served by Express (static middleware is present in `server.js`).
- Verify health by visiting `https://<your-backend>.onrender.com/` and `https://<your-backend>.onrender.com/api/potholes`.

## Frontend (Static Site or Web Service)

- Option A (Static Site): Build and deploy `frontend/dist` as a static site.
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `frontend/dist`
- Option B (Web Service): Deploy as a web service that runs a server to serve `dist`.

### Environment variables (frontend site settings):

- `VITE_API_URL` - set to your backend URL (e.g. `https://<your-backend>.onrender.com`)

## Post-deploy verification

- Check the frontend loads and makes API calls to `VITE_API_URL`.
- Open browser DevTools → Network to confirm requests to `https://<your-backend>.onrender.com/api/*`.
- Verify authentication flows work (login/signup) and cookies are being set (if using cookies for JWT).
- Verify image uploads (Cloudinary) function correctly via the UI or `POST /api/upload/image`.

## Security & Maintenance

- Rotate any keys accidentally committed to GitHub immediately.
- Use Render secrets for environment variables — do not commit `.env` files.
- Enable HTTPS (Render provides it by default) and set proper CORS origins.
